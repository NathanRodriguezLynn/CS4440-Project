# CS4440-Project: Process Synchronization
  + Make a fast-food burger shop, and ensure orders are completed promptly and correctly
  + In order to achieve synchronous tasks, we will ensure different order items are completed/started simultaneously
  + Different dining scenarios will be made to keep things interesting
  + Threads? - meats down, cook fries, prepare drinks, gather utensils, build burger, package everything, serve (transactions?)
  + Additional Threads? -> have 2-3 cooks as threads
